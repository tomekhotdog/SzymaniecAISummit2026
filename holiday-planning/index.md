## How This Was Made

This entire planning document was created in a 45-minute session with 6 people contributing ideas and one person typing into Claude.

The AI helped us:
- Ask the right questions
- Structure messy input
- Generate options we hadn't considered
- Create a fair comparison framework
- Synthesise a recommendation everyone could support

No templates. No spreadsheets. Just conversation → structured output.
