Each family member confesses their ChatGPT usage. No judgement. Okay, some judgement.

Suggested topics:

- Michal: "Summarising HMRC guidance no human should have to read"
- Ola: "Drafting emails that sound less annoyed than I actually am"

- Maria: "I use it for everything and I'm not ashamed" (the power user)

Biscuits will be served. Complaints about the previous session encouraged.

**11:00 – 11:45 | HANDS-ON WORKSHOP: INTRODUCTION TO CLAUDE**
*"The Other One (That's Actually Better)"*

Collaborative session where we tackle a single example project together as a group.

- Live demonstration: Building something useful as a team
- Everyone contributes ideas while the Organiser drives

Post-screening discussion: "Wait, is this... actually quite profound?"

---

**15:15 onwards | FIRESIDE CHAT**
*"What Does This Mean For Us?"*
