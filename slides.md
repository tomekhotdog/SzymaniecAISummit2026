# The Szymaniec Family AI Summit 2026
## *From Prompts to Possibilities*

January 1st | 3 Hampshire Rise

---

# Today's Agenda

1. **ChatGPT Confession Session** — What have we all been using it for?
2. **Introduction to Claude** — The other one (that's actually better)
3. **Documentary** — "The Thinking Game"
4. **Your Turn** — Bring your own problem

---

# The ChatGPT Confession Session
## *No judgement. Okay, some judgement.*

What have you actually been using it for?

---

# Why Claude?

- It **thinks before it speaks** (extended thinking)
- Better at **complex reasoning**
- Doesn't make things up as often
- Can work with **files and projects**, not just chat

---

# What We're Going to Build

## Plan the Next Szymaniec Family Holiday

Together. Live. In 45 minutes.

---

# The Process

1. **Gather the brief** — What do we want?
2. **Preferences matrix** — What does each person need?
3. **Generate options** — Where could we go?
4. **Compare trade-offs** — How do they stack up?
5. **Recommendation** — What should we do?

---

# What You'll See

- Claude asking the right questions
- Our messy input → structured output
- Multiple files being created
- A real project emerging from conversation

---

# Let's Go

*[Live demo begins]*

---

# What Just Happened?

We went from "let's go on holiday" to:

- A structured brief
- Everyone's preferences documented
- 4 researched options
- A comparison matrix
- A clear recommendation

In 45 minutes. With no templates.

# The Parallels

| Person | What this looks like for you |
|--------|------------------------------|
| Michal | Client investment decisions |
| Ola | Structuring a client matter |
| Maria | A mini strategy engagement |
| Dad | Hypothesis → evidence → conclusion |
| Mum | "I just tell it what I want" |

# Workshop Part II
## Your Turn

Bring a real problem from your life or work.

We'll tackle it together.

---

# Ideas for Part II

- **Property analysis:** Should we buy a holiday home together?
- **Your actual work:** A real problem you're stuck on
- **Life admin:** Something you've been putting off

---

# The Bigger Picture

This isn't about replacing thinking.

It's about **having a collaborator** that:
- Remembers everything
- Stays organised
- Pushes back when needed
- Never gets tired

---

# Thank You

Now let's have tea and discuss whether AI will take our jobs.

*Spoiler: It's more complicated than that.*
